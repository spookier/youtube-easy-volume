## The problem with YouTube's volume slider
YouTube's volume control design increments or decrements the volume level in steps of 3-5% rather than 1% increments  

While these larger steps make it easier and quicker for most users to adjust the volume to a noticeably different level, they can be less ideal for situations where fine-tuning is required



## My solution
EasyVolume for YouTube fills this gap by enabling you to fine-tune the volume with 1% increments  

This finer control allows users to set the volume at the exact level that suits their preference, their environment, or the specific requirements of the media they are consuming

It's the perfect tool for users who need fine-grained audio adjustments for their YouTube videos
